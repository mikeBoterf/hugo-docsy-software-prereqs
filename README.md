# hugo-install
Just simple ansible scripts to install hugo stuff. 

## Run it
```
ansible-playbook init-hugo-workstation.yml
```
It will

- Install golang
  - version is hardcoded.. that will change in the future hopefully
- Install hugo
  - version is hardcoded.. that will change in the future hopefully
- Install NPM
  - this uses package.. so your milage may vary.

# tl;dr
each script does a task of installing

feel free to add input. I did this in a couple mins.
